Similarity in this case means coincidence of factors listed above.\n"

In other words if I move from Toronto to NYC obviously it means some raise in my income which allows me to rent more expensive apartment and vice versa. \nSo compare apples to apples rent cost should be ajusted accordingly, so it is going to be another input for the solution\n\n"
